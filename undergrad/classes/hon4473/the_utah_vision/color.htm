      <h3>Color and Light</h3>
      <p>Color and light are the elements most related to emotion. Our environment, our culture and our visual perception condition our awareness of color. Color also effects us intuitively, arousing an instinctual response. Our emotions are directly effected by color, as it conditions our moods, thoughts, actions and even our health. </p>
      <p>For the artist, color is most often reefers to the light reflected from the surface of a work; however, an electric source or white light (sunlight) may also generate color. </p>
      <p>Light is not only used to generate color, but to create the illusion of three-dimensional forms on a two-dimensional surface. This is done through the rendering of the effects of light and shadow as they fall on solid forms. </p>
      <p>The emotions that light and dark arouse within us is an embedded, instinctual reaction. Light in our culture expresses goodness, intelligence, clarity and completeness. Darkness is just the opposite, expressing mystery, ignorance, evil and emptiness. The contrast between dark and light not only describes space and defines forms in art; it also conveys feeling, drama and a psychological element as well as an aesthetic dynamic. </p>
      <h3>Utah Artists and Color and Light</h3>
      <p>Utah Artists make great use of color and light in their artwork. The prevalence of landscape and nature in Utah allows for the re-creation of the magnificent sights throughout the state.</p>
      <p>This inspiration for the use of color and light does not only come from the natural surroundings. Utah, in general, is highly conservative and spiritual. The conservative nature of this state has dictated much of the artistic economy in the region, leading to the production of more conservative subject matter. In the case of Utah artists, this resulted in an overwhelming amount of landscape images. </p>
      The images are more than just simple landscapes though. The use of color and light as the artists depict the geography of the state of Utah, give hints to us of a deeper, more spiritual intervention within these landscapes.
      <h3>Jeperson&rsquo;s <em>Mountain Landscape in the Sun</em>: an Example of Light and Color in Use</h3>
      <p>Looking at Jeperson&rsquo;s image, <em>Mountain Landscape in the Sun</em>, we see a wonderful demonstration of the colors and light that are apart of the natural beauty that is Utah.&nbsp; There are a wide variety of warm colors that are highlighted and accentuated by the glowing sun that breaks through the top of the painting. </p>
      <p>The colors and light that penetrate the whole of this image easily give the viewer the feeling of a higher inspiration.&nbsp; This is used to inspire the same feelings of awe that are present in one as they stand before beauty and power of nature. </p>
