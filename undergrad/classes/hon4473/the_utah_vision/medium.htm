      <h3>Medium</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;Medium is the material or materials, such as clay, paint or pencil that are used in a work of art. Any substance added to the color to facilitate application or to achieve a desired effect falls into the category of medium as well. There are many materials used as media in artworks.&nbsp; Those media demonstrated in this exhibit are oil paint, watercolor and etching. </p>
      <p>Oil paint is one of the &ldquo;great classic media&rdquo;. Oils are popularly used for their versatility, offering the ability to create the transparent and the opaque in one work.&nbsp; Oils are praised for their ease of manipulation. They can be applied very thinly for a smooth picture plane that does not draw our attention to brushwork, or they can be applied very thickly and roughly, demonstrating application techniques.</p>
      <p>Watercolor paint is a paint that uses water as a solvent and vehicle.&nbsp; The artist determines the intensity of the resulting color by how much water is mixed with the paint. Watercolor paint soaks into the material that it is applied to, turning the material that the paint is applied to into the actual picture, rather than creating an image on top of the canvas or paper. </p>
      <p>An etching is a print made from a metal plate covered with wax or a similar protective material. This protective layer is cut into with a sharp object and then submerged in acid, eroding the areas which were exposed by the needle, and making them receptive to ink and color. </p>
      <h3>Utah Artists and Medium</h3>
      <p>The landscape of Utah is a varied one.&nbsp; There are snow-capped mountains in the northeast as two ranges of the Rockies, the Wasatch Range and the Uinta Range run through Utah.&nbsp; The western part of the state is part of the Basins and Ridges region of the United States. This region covers several states with small mountains and basins and is one of the driest regions. In the northeast corner of this region lies the Great Salt Lake and the Great Salt Lake Desert.&nbsp; The southern and eastern regions of the state are covered by the Colorado Plateau, which is characterized by high country cut by deep canyons and valleys.&nbsp; This not mention the many small parks and large National Parks that spot the state.</p>
      <p>With this vast and diverse topography, Utah artists engage multiple media to express precisely the sense that one gains from being in that particular landscape of Utah. Oil paints allow for more intense color and more varied surface textures, just as one would see as they traveled through the rough, dry rock formations of southern Utah, or the smooth, clean surface one would see on the snow covered mountains of northeastern Utah. Watercolors allow for the clarity of the unpolluted landscape and sky that one can see almost any day.

      <h3>J.T. Harwood&rsquo;s Dirt<em> Road Etching</em>: an Example of Medium in Use</h3>
      <p>This image by J.T. Harwood, not only utilizes the medium of etching, but also combines that with the medium of oil paint to add color to the image. </p>
      Looking at this image, we see the incised lines to create the outlines of shapes within the scene. These outlines are then filled in with color by the oil paints to create a unique image. The use of two different media allows Harwood to create variety in the landscape and in the depiction of the natural elements of the landscape.
