      <h3>Texture</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;The texture of an artwork can be either real or imagined. In two-dimensional artworks, the artist may produce a smooth or a rough surface in the application of the medium.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;In examples of a smooth surface, nothing on the picture plane draws attention to the application of the paint on the surface.&nbsp; Yet, the artist still has the ability to illusively create a variety of materials, objects, and textures through the application of delicate brush strokes and thin layers of paint.</p>
      &nbsp;Conversely, the thicker and quicker paint application creates a consistently rough surface on the picture plane, which draws attention to the paint and its method of application. The high viscosity of the paint is apparent and contributes significantly to the aesthetic content of works were such a technique is used.
      <h3>Utah Artists and Texture</h3>
      <p>Just as Utah Artists found innovative ways to apply paint to the surface of the picture plane in order to create a diverse visual and tactile experience through texture, the Utah landscape, through its diverse and vast expanse, adds texture to the picture plane that is the landscape of Utah and America. </p>
      <p>The people of Utah tend to be very environmentally conscious, and why shouldn&rsquo;t they be? After all, they have a large stretch of beautiful and diverse land at their fingertips. Utah residents see it fit that they help preserve the diversity of Utah&rsquo;s landscape and America&rsquo;s landscape as a whole.&nbsp; The artists of Utah while creating accurate visual representations, are preserving a part of Utah geographical history, are also reminding us of why we should all contribute to persevering the real landscape that is Utah. </p>
      <h3>J.T. Harwood&rsquo;s <em>Liberty Park:</em> an Example of Texture in Use</h3>
      <p>Utah artist J.T. Harwood reminds us of the diversity of nature and how that diversity can be depicted as we look as his <em>Liberty Park</em>. Not only do we see the beauty of nature in this scene, but we see the people that enjoy this beauty as well, just as many Utah residents do.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Hardwood&rsquo;s application of the paint allows us to examine the texture of the paint as applied to the surface of the canvas, as well as to examine the different textures of the many natural elements as well.&nbsp; For example, look at how Harwood uses the thick and quick application of oil paint to show the rippling waters of the pond that flows in the park.</p>
