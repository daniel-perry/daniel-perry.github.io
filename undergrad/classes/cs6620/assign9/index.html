<p>A simple example of using the instancing class to rotate and translate the
center brown box in 3 different ways.  The Top left box is just rotated and
translated, the bottom left box is rotated, sheared, resized and translated, and
the bottom right box is rotated, translated and resized.</p>

<i>Design Decisions:</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this assignment, I implemented a new class called
TInstance to handle the instancing.  I used a matrix class I wrote in a
previous class to handle the rotation,resizing,shearing and translation math.  The class
basically includes a pointer to the original object, the translation matrix,
the inverse of the translation matrix, and a pointer to a new material class to use for shading.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The TInstance class also has different member functions
to perform each type of translation: one for a Point, one for a Vector, and one
for a Normal.  This type of design makes the interface clean, simple, and hard
to mess up.  It was also recommended in Shirley's book.  The TInstance class is
a subclass of my Primitive class, so that it can be treated like any other
primitive in the system.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One change I made to the system was to start
using the scratchpad in my HitRecord.  I had evaded using it until now, but found it quite
convenient to hold the hitpoint of the last intersected object, as opposed to
trying to recalculate the t-value on the original ray from the translated ray's
t-value.(this was because previousely for shading routines and the like, I had been simply
recalculating the hit point from the t-value stored in the HitRecord).  I don't
know if this will provide for headaches in the future, but it seemed to help
out for this assignment.
