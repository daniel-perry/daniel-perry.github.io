<b><i>Assignment 4:</i></b>

<p>This image is to show off the new material types implemented this round.
Appearing for the first time are: two glass spheres, two phong spheres (gold
and pink), a large metal sphere (at top), and the tip-top of a metal box (on
bottom).  The rest of the floor is a purple Lambertian plain and a green phong
disk (with the metal box centered in that).  Notice the reflection of all the
spheres in the big sphere, and in the top of the box on the bottom.  Neat-o.</p>
<br><br>
<i>Extra Credit: coupled material implementation</i><br>
<img src="coup_img1.png"><br>
<p>Here are two spheres, the one on the left is purely Phong shaded, while the
sphere on the right is shaded using the Coupled material (glossy surface).  Now
I wasn't entirely sure how to check for correctness, but I thought it looked
pretty good... Notice the blue reflections of the background on the edges of
the sphere on the right.</p>
<br><br>

<p>Same spheres, only now with a goldish surface color...</p>

<i>Design Decisions:</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this assignment, I implemented 4 new Material
classes, PhongMaterial, MetalMaterial, DielectricMaterial, and
CoupledMaterial.  I was able to keep using the basic infrastructure already
established with some changes this time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, several interfaces were overloaded to match the
interface used in the req.h files (so that I can include them without having
to change it).  This also required some typedef's so that my names like
vector3d and rgb are understood as Vector and Color.  This made sense since now
my interfaces match those given in assignments, whereas before they didn't
(which is a pain).  I guess I'm a conformist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had some trouble getting the transparent material
working for a while there, because my box intersection code wasn't
correct... somehow it slipped through the other assignments.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the reflection and transparent materials, I used
schlicks approximation, for the obvious speed advantage, and they seem to look
pretty good.  For the transparent material, I was getting really slow render
times (about 39 seconds for the required image).  After implementing the "ray
trimming" that time dropped considerably (for the required image, down to 4 seconds).  Althought still
not ideal, it is at least reasonable.  If I have more time later on, I'd like
to optimize more to get my rendering time down.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assignment seemed considerably less painfull than
past assignments, though seemed to make the images appear much better.  Cool stuff...
