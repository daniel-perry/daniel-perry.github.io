<i>Design Decisions:</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to make something like the fractal trees shown in class, and in the paper references.  I didn't have enough time to really get it looking exactly like the paper, and here they don't look that real, but it looks kind of neat none the less.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to creat fractal like images, I implemented a PrimitiveGroup class, to which I can apply instancing.  It seemed pretty sleek at first, until I ran into problems with way I was constructing my BVH... but after a while, it seems to have turned out okay.<br>

<i>Design Decisions (continued):</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to the final image I had to implement some more things, like soft shadows, and grouped instancing.  I also implemented some functionality I didn't get done in past assignments, like a working bvh.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stated above, to do group instancing, I created a GroupPrimitive class, which necessitated some changes to my BVH construction as well.  I was having a silly problem with my BVH, I wasn't testing both branches - just returning the first branch with a successfull hit.  For soft shadows, I implemented a new light subclass called AreaLight.  It acts more as a range for random point lights.  When I ask for the point and direction of the light source, the area light class returns a jittered distributed point light point, where all points have the same light color.  It would be cool to see what happens to vary the light color across the area of the light... maybe later.
