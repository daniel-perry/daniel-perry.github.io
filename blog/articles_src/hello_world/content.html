<h3>Starting again...</h3>

<p>
I have found in the past that writing about technical topics is a great way to internalize them.  I've decided to start again doing this via a blog.
</p>
<p>
Rather than use a blogging service, this time I am using a static generator on my github pages.  
To get started rather than figuring out a real static site generator, I have just cobbled together some python scripts, you're welcome to go take a look at them <a href="https://github.com/daniel-perry/daniel-perry.github.io/tree/master/blog">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Previous blog efforts can be found <a href="/class/index.html">here</a>, along with some grad school coursework links.
